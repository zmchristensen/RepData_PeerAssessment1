## Needed libraries
```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data[,2] <- ymd(data[,2])
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
daily_totals <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(Date = data$date), FUN = sum, na.rm = T)
hist(daily_totals[,2], breaks = 8, col = "steelblue", main = "Total Steps per Day", xlab = "Total Steps per Day")
```
### Compute the mean and median
```{r echo = FALSE}
summary(daily_totals$x)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
interval_means <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(interval = data$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = T)
plot(interval_means[,1], interval_means[,2], type = "l", col = "steelblue", main = "Average Steps Per Interval", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps")
```
### Which interval had the highest average activity?
```{r echo = FALSE}
arrange(interval_means, desc(x))[1,]
```

## Inputing missing values
```{r missingValues}
is_na <- is.na(data[,1])
na_count <- sum(is_na)

updated_data <- inner_join(data, interval_means)
updated_data[is_na,2] <- updated_data[is_na,4]
updated_daily_totals <- aggregate(updated_data$steps, by = list(Date = updated_data$date), FUN = sum, na.rm = T)
hist(updated_daily_totals[,2], breaks = 8, col = "steelblue", main = "Total Steps per Day", xlab = "Total Steps per Day")
summary(updated_daily_totals[,2])
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r dayDifferences}
days <- weekdays(updated_data[,3])
weekdays <- days == "Monday" | days == "Tuesday" | days == "Wednesday" | days == "Thursday" | days == "Friday"

week_data <- data.frame(updated_data, days, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
week_data[weekdays,5] <- "Weekday"
week_data[!weekdays,5] <- "Weekend"

week_totals <- aggregate(week_data$steps, by = list(Day = week_data[,5], Interval = week_data$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = T)

weekend <- filter(week_totals, Day == "Weekend")
weekday <- filter(week_totals, Day == "Weekday")
plot(weekend$Interval, weekend$x, type = "l", col = "steelblue", main = "Average Steps Per Interval", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps")
lines(weekday$Interval, weekday$x, col = "seagreen")
legend("topright", lwd = 1, legend = c("Weekend", "Weekday"), col = c("steelblue", "seagreen"))


```
